# Details about the project 
***The Problem Statement :*** 
The aim is to create a rewards calculation system that calculates the total monthly reward points earned based on a customer's credit card purchases. More than one reward points calculation rules could apply to a merchant’s transaction(s) and the system should maximize the calculated points for a merchant by considering different priorities or combinations of the rules.


***Sample Transactions :***
Here is a list of transactions for a customer that needs to be considered for your solution.
```
transactions = {
  "T01": {"date": "2021-05-01", "merchant_code" : "sportcheck", "amount_cents": 21000},
  "T02": {"date": "2021-05-02", "merchant_code" : "sportcheck", "amount_cents": 8700},
  "T03": {"date": "2021-05-03", "merchant_code" : "tim_hortons", "amount_cents": 323},
  "T04": {"date": "2021-05-04", "merchant_code" : "tim_hortons", "amount_cents": 1267},
  "T05": {"date": "2021-05-05", "merchant_code" : "tim_hortons", "amount_cents": 2116},
  "T06": {"date": "2021-05-06", "merchant_code" : "tim_hortons", "amount_cents": 2211},
  "T07": {"date": "2021-05-07", "merchant_code" : "subway", "amount_cents": 1853},
  "T08": {"date": "2021-05-08", "merchant_code" : "subway", "amount_cents": 2153},
  "T09": {"date": "2021-05-09", "merchant_code" : "sportcheck", "amount_cents": 7326},
  "T10": {"date": "2021-05-10", "merchant_code" : "tim_hortons", "amount_cents": 1321}
}
```

***The Ask :***
Assuming that each $1 spend is only counted once, implement a method that takes the customer transactions as an input (Merchant Code -> Purchase Amount) and calculates the total maximum rewards points earned for the month , the maximum reward points applied for each transaction.

***Rules :***
```
● Rule 1: 500 points for every $75 spend at Sport Check, $25 spend at Tim Hortons and $25 spend at Subway
● Rule 2: 300 points for every $75 spend at Sport Check and $25 spend at Tim Hortons
● Rule 3: 200 points for every $75 spend at Sport Check
● Rule 4: 150 points for every $25 spend at Sport Check, $10 spend at Tim Hortons and $10 spend at Subway
● Rule 5: 75 points for every $25 spend at Sport Check and $10 spend at Tim Hortons
● Rule 6: 75 point for every $20 spend at Sport Check
● Rule 7: 1 points for every $1 spend for all other purchases (including leftover amount)
```

## Examples

Here are a few examples to help understand how to use rules to calculate the reward points. Each example has a set of transactions and rules to use for reward points calculation. These examples may not necessarily be the solution to the main problem.

### Example 1
***Transactions :***
```
transactions = {
  'T1': {'date': '2021-05-09', 'merchant_code' : 'sportcheck', 'amount_cents': 7326},
  'T2': {'date': '2021-05-10', 'merchant_code' : 'tim_hortons', 'amount_cents': 1321}
}
```

***Rules :***
```
● Rule 1: 10 points for every $1 spend at Sport Check 
```

***Solution :***
```
● Rule 1: 10 points for every $1 spend at Sport Check => Promotion Applied x 73

Total Points: 730

Transaction Level Points:
● T1 - 730
● T2 - 0
```

### Example 2
***Transactions :***
```
transactions = {
  'T1': {'date': '2021-05-09', 'merchant_code' : 'sportcheck', 'amount_cents': 7326},
  'T2': {'date': '2021-05-10', 'merchant_code' : 'tim_hortons', 'amount_cents': 1321}
}
```

***Rules :***
```
● Rule 1: 10 points for every $1 spend at Sport Check
● Rule 2: 100 points for every $5 spend at Sport Check
```

***Solution :***
```
● Rule 1: 10 points for every $1 spend at Sport Check => Promotion Applied x 3
● Rule 2: 100 points for every $5 spend at Sport Check => Promotion Applied x 14

Total Points: 1430

Transaction Level Points:
● T1 - 1430
● T2 - 0
```


### Example 3
***Transactions :***
```
transactions = {
  'T1': {'date': '2021-05-09', 'merchant_code' : 'sportcheck', 'amount_cents': 7326},
  'T2': {'date': '2021-05-10', 'merchant_code' : 'tim_hortons', 'amount_cents': 1321}
}
```

***Rules :***
```
● Rule 1: 100 points for every $5 spend at Sport Check
● Rule 2: 10 points for every $1 spend for all other purchases
```

***Solution :***
```
● Rule 1: 100 points for every $5 spend at Sport Check => Promotion Applied x 14
● Rule 2: 10 points for every $1 spend for all other purchases (including leftover amount) => Promotion Applied x 16

Total Points: 1560

Transaction Level Points:
● T1 - 1430
● T2 - 130
```

### Example 4
***Transactions :***
```
transactions = {
  'T1': {'date': '2021-05-09', 'merchant_code' : 'sportcheck', 'amount_cents': 2500},
  'T2': {'date': '2021-05-10', 'merchant_code' : 'tim_hortons', 'amount_cents': 1000},
  'T3’: {'date': '2021-05-10', 'merchant_code' : 'the_bay', 'amount_cents': 500}
}
```

***Rules :***
```
Same rules as stated in the main problem.
```

***Solution :***
```
● Rule 6: 75 point for every $20 spend at Sport Check => Promotion Applied x 1
● Rule 7: 1 points for every $1 spend for all other purchases (including leftover amount) => Promotion Applied x 20

Total points: 95

Transaction level points:
● T1 - 80 (rule 6 & 7)
● T2 - 10 (rule 7)
● T3 - 5 (rule 7)
```

***Explanation :***
```
Two sets of rules apply to this input
● If you use combination rules 5 and 7, the total points is 80 but that’s not the max total that can be achieved.
● If you use combination rules 6 and 7, the total points is 95 which is the correct solution.
```
